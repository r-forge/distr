"still alive" note ...

as you have noticed, we are behind schedule: Unfortunately, we didn't manage to complete the revision of our packages over the Christmas holidays as planned (and announced to you), and since the regular winter term has resumed Jan 08, we have been busy with other duties@the faculty ... and with teaching. We are aware that some of our reverse dependencies will now have to remain in limbo with us, but there is light@the end of the tunnel and we should be back on track by the end of the winter term due for Feb 02. 

TLDR: Please give us some more time, we are on it.

Best, Peter

Apologies if I sounded offending [which was not intended!], and if you are held up by our 
non-submission of an intermediate quick fix of our packages; I would have guessed that 
error-clean code should be given higher priority ...

In short, I cannot currently submit any new version of distr, as there is an 
error currently reported on CRAN checks summaries thrown at an example in the help
of Binom(). It can quickly be reproduced through  

require(distr);distr::Binom(prob=0.5, size=2)+distr::Binom(prob=0.6, size=1)

Unfortunately, this is hard to fix for me, as on my system on the most recent R devel 
version R-4.4.0unstable from 2024-01-25 r85826 ucrt, everything runs cleanly. 
For details of sessionInfo() see below. 

My guess (without being able to check it) is that the error indeed, as has presumed  
Matthias DÃ¶ring in his post Jan 13, connected to recent changes in the S4 dispachting 
mechanism when using setAs coercing.

I will spend some time on this during the weekend (and plan to try an OpenSuse VM as an
alternative OS).

Any hints on this are highly appreciated.


I want to make clear that I was not dishonest to any of you in any of my mails. 
The current error is new to me, I first saw it today when getting back on my R pkgs, 
after being occupied at work after my return from X-mas holiday Jan 08.

To be transparent: Our to-do-list before X-mas was containing issues [1-3] as raised by 
CRAN and [4,5] brought up in between by C. Dalitz. All of them had been fixed by Dec 19,
but as indicated we wanted to do thorough checkings over X-mas which we did (but did not
finish) against R-4.4.0unstable from 2023-12-21 r85716. In order to prevent errors as in 
[4,5], some enhancements are in our pipeline enabling to detect such things in our package. 

When I wrote that these glitches (I meant [4,5]) had not yet been found by CRAN checks, 
this was not meant as criticism about the CRAN checks. It is obvious that such pkg-specific 
errors cannot be detected by whatsoever smart CRAN checks, but have to be prevented by
code in our package. Still, in my opinion errors like [4,5] are more serious than the 
issues [1-3], which is why we insisted on thorough checking. 


[1] a pkg version out of sync in the package man page 
[2] obsolete latin1 package encoding 
[3] a note which originally was suspected to be connected to changes in the methods package,
    but which by some hints of Michael Laurence could be tracked to a wrong 'usage' entry 
	in an internal Rd file
[4] an error thrown in the group of binary math operators in our distribution arithmetics 
    if at one operand one of positive or negative part is a Dirac measure  
[5] an error thrown in the convolution method of (DiscreteDistribution,DiscreteDistribution)

(1) the error visible in cran checks right now is hard for us to track (and as said was not 
    present during our checks around Xmas)
    it is thrown in the examples, and can be shortened to:
	we cannot reproduce this on our systems, i.e.,
