subject: distr-2.9.0 is on its way to CRAN -- thank you!

Dear Elio, Andrew, Santosh, and Vlada,

[in chronological order of your contributions]

This is to notify you that we have just released to CRAN a new version
of our R package distr and to thank you for helping us in improving
our package. 

The actual CRAN release is triggered by some mail from CRAN/Kurt Hornik 
2022-11-07, complaining about some flaws in the HTML versions of our 
manuals, detected by the most recent version of R CMD check. 

These flaws are fixed, together with some updated URLs.

More importantly, we want to explicitely thank you for your contributions 
which have finally found their way to a CRAN release:

+ Elio Campitelli <elio.campitelli@cima.fcen.uba.ar> drew our attention to
  a glitch in catching argument names in bAcDcLcDistribution.R
+ Andrew Robinson <apro@unimelb.edu.au> brought up some error in 
  distributional arithmetics: To produce meaningful error messages we had 
  code that tried to deparse operands in operations with restricted 
  definition domains like "/", "^"; it turned our that our idea to 
  catch errorsin this deparsing within a try()-catch did not work 
  any longer when called from within a function; as way out, we now 
  have code which no longer needs the try()-catch and instead climbs 
  up the parsing tree and searches for the first occurrence of "/" 
  resp. "^" and deparses this
+ Santhosh V <Santhosh.V@se.com> detected some glitch when producing
  slot q for compound and mixing distributions  
+ Vlada Milchevskaya <vmilchev@uni-koeln.de> pointed us to the case
  for CompoundDistribution() that argument NumbOfSummandsDistr is a 
  Dirac distribution which needed special treatment

Best regards, Peter
